- Built on React's native [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
- [Works with Server Side Rendering](https://ryandrewjohnson.github.io/react-localize-redux-docs/#working-with-server-side-rendering).
- [Include inline default translations](https://ryandrewjohnson.github.io/react-localize-redux-docs/#include-inline-default-translations)
- [Render React components from translations](https://ryandrewjohnson.github.io/react-localize-redux-docs/#react-translations).
- [Dynamic translations](https://ryandrewjohnson.github.io/react-localize-redux-docs/#dynamic-translations)
